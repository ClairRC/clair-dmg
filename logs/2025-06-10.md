Hello I am going to start logging my progress and thoughts here as I go. This is moreso for my benefit than anybody else's so I can get my thoughts out and not have to keep thinking about them. That said, if anyone is reading this, hi! :)

Anyway, the progress I made today was finishing implementing my read/write memory functions, at least for the time being. I did not get much work done today, but it is still a milestone, so I'm happy with that.

My next goal is going to be to actually implement the instruction loop. At first, the intention is going to simply be to read the instructions from a test ROM. I'm not sure which, if any, can be run without visuals, but that's fine. Honestly being able to actually see the program running and outputting values that are correct will be a huge boost in motivation, and if I can run one of those test ROMs, it would be even nicer because I can finally check to make sure I haven't massively messed up yet. I still have a number of edge cases to handle, but for now I think I'm going to ignore most of those. I'm going to just read the instructions and execute them. Some weird edge cases include implementing HALT instructions and weirdness. I might try to handle that in my initial implementation, but we'll see. 

Ultimately, the instruction loop will probably follow the general format of: Check halted status, fetch instruction, decode instruction (get it from the lookup table), execute the instruction, update the number of cycles passed that frame, update DMA transfer status, update hardware like the PPU, check for interrupts and handle those as necessary... I think that I've implemented enough to do all of that with the exception of updating hardware status because I don't have visuals or input or audio yet. This is just a general "off the top of my head" kind of plan, and I'm sure it will not be as nice once I get around to actually doing it... I'm going to have to figure out how to handle real timing as well as learn more about system timing. That's a tomorrow issue though.

After I can actually execute instructions, I'll begin to work on visuals, which would be an even greater boost in motivation! The PPU seems to have a lot of really weird little timing things, weird conditions it needs to check, and things like that. I have sooome plans to make it nicer I think. I was originally planning to have boolean flags for all the little weird things, but honestly I might do something like macros that actually check the exact memory location for those flags and returns the exact bit I'm supposed to be looking for. It would help with clutter a lot. I've been thinking about that kind of thing a lot this project, which I think is a result of the fact that it's so... Step based, so there's a lot of tedious moments, and macros for basic little function calls like that have been a godsend over doing all the weird bitwise math each time it comes up. Either way, the important thing is that the PPU comes after the basic instruction loop, and I will have to do a LOT of research on its exact behavior, but I'm ready to finally move on from CPU/ISA/MMU stuff.

I think that since I have experience using OpenGL, I will use that to handle the frame buffer stuff. Plus, if I want I can implement fun shader effects, which would be super fun to mess around with, and also just a unique feature. And again, my (relatively little) OpenGL experience should make that a bit less of a learning curve. I will also probably use SDL to handle like the OpenGL context and input and menus and things like that. I've never used SDL, but I can't imagine that it will take me more than a couple of days to figure out what I need from it.

Either way, I'm excited to continue this project, and hopefully within a week or two I'll finally be able to see some progress with visuals! Then I get to dive into audio, which I do not even know where to start with because I've been intentionally not really thinking about it. Theeen I guess just include the CGB exclusive behavior and at that point it's basically done :)
